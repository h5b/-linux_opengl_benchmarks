 Create a new folder, copy in the files from the 32bit or 64bit
 directories. Include ogl1.c, the BMP files from the textures
 bmp folder and the runit file. Change lines 19 to 20 of ogl1.c
 to comment out as appropriate for:

 #define version  "32 Bit Version 1" or
 #define version  "64 Bit Version 1"

 Open a Terminal and cd to point to the new folder. Compile for
 32 bits using:

 gcc ogl1.c cpuidc.o cpuida.o -lrt -lc -lm -O3 -lglut -lGLU -o videogl32

 or for 64 bits:

 gcc ogl1.c cpuidc64.o cpuida64.o -m64 -lrt -lc -lm -O3 -lglut -lGLU -o videogl64


 Run using ./videogl32 or ./videogl64 or edit the runit script file
 and use ./runit

 File libglut.xo.3 is required at run time. If OpenGL Utility Toolkit
 (GLUT) is not installed copy the file from bin32 or bin64 into the new
 folder and execute the command in set LIBRARY_PATH.txt:

 export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/

 Or find and install freeglut for the particular distro.
